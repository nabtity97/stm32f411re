Wiring of the ESP8266-01 WIFI module.



I have connected the WIFI module to the USB/TTL converter (It operates with 3.3 Volt)

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	ESP8266-01		USB/TTL

&nbsp;	VCC			 3.3V 

&nbsp;	CH\_EN			 3.3V

&nbsp;	But I used the 3.3V of the Nucleo board 	not from the USB/TTL, because the current 	of the TTL is not enough.

&nbsp;	Attention: the Power led should be always 

&nbsp;	on.

&nbsp;	RX			  TX

&nbsp;	TX			  RX
